logo. Where deep brown is uesed as the main theme, lighter colour is used as corresponding
design.

- Considering Fixing (Adding) New User Stories:
In order for us to set a better objectives for both restaurants and customers, we are considering
to add more user stories on Jira.

- Emais in Registeration:
The website now allows uers to register. Email's format is checked, that is, must contains 
"@" and ".com". Users that fail to provide email address in the correct formats will fail
to proceede to the next page.

- Passwords in Registeration:
The passwords provided by users must contain 8 digits. In these 8 digits, users must provide
letters, capital letters, and numbers. Users that fail to set passwords with correct formats 
will fail to proceed to the next page.

- Matching Passwords in Registeration:
The system will require confirmation of password by requiring users for the second instance 
of inputting their passwords. They can only proceed to the next page if and only if both
passwords provided matches exactly with each other.

- Retrieving Password in Log-In Page:
Given that the users have forgortten their password, the system will require the registered
users to provide the email that they've registered with. The system will then send a recovery
code to this email. If the code provided by the users is the same as the code sent by the
system, then the users will be able to reset the password by proceeding to the next screen.

- Overall Home Page Layout:
The overall layout of the home page for a "restaurant" user is set. In this page, the restaurant
manager will be able to view their restaurant name, address, and the dishes that they are 
offering. 

- Editting Dishes:
Dishes can be editted when clicked. Elements and properties such as the name of the dish, price, 
and description of the dish can be updated and adjusted. More importantly, the image corresponding
to the dishes can also be re-uploaded.

- Vouchers Types:
The system will offer 4 different types of vouchers. This includes, percentage discounts, free food 
vouchers, money off when spent over certain price, and buy one get one free. The main themes used
are extracted from the colour used on chocolates placed on the donut logo.

- Voucher Configuration:
The system allows users to change the description of the voucher, which will be rendered directly.

- Vouchers Releasing (Manually):
The restaurant manager will be able to release the voucher according to the a set target. And the
vouchers will be collected untill its is all consumed or collected by users. Then the vouchers will 
turn grey meaning that it can no longer be collected.

- Vouchers Releasing (Automatically):
The system has a built-in timer. This timer will allow users to set a schedule and releasing amount
and the system will automatically release vouchers according to the provided schedule and amount. 
For example, releasing 20 vouchers every hour for 2 days, in which the system will release 20 voucher
in the first hour, 20 in the second hour and so on. The vouchers will turn grey when the set amount
has been collected in the set period.

- Ratings:
The consumers may be able to rate the restaurant on a scale from 1-5. The ratings will appear next 
to the corresponding reviews. 

- Sending Reviews:
The consumers may be able to leave comments or reviews on the restaurant page, which is accessable
to the entire user communities (both users and restaurant managers). 

- Replying Reviews:
Both users can reply to certain comments. The replies can also be further replied. A button is provided
to fold (Hide) all comments. A reply can be created by clicking the folding back arrow button.

- Report Reviews:
To eliminate reviews that are potentially misleading or typical harrasements, the system will also be
equipped with a report functionalities. A counter is provided, if a comment is reported 5 times or
above, it will be removed from the database, where others will no longer see it. If a commment is
remvoed, all corresponding replies that fold underneath it are also removed.

- Annomynous Reviews:
The users can also decide if they want their comments or reviews to be annomynous. If they do, the 
system will be able to hide their profile picture as well as their name.
